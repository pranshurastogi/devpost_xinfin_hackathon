## Ideation - 
There are millions of flights scheduled everyday and taht may lead to the delay in arrival that may cause serious issue to the passenger and flight companies also face many defamation. My idea is to create the decentralised process for the registeration of flights, come into consensus and provide the insurance claim to the customer without any involvement of third party and hassle free process.
